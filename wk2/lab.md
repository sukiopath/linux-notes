**Instructions**

**Part One: 2 points**

Use the `man` page for the `uname` utility to find out which option you should use if you want to only display the "kernel-release" (short or long format are both fine) 

Take two screenshots for this: 
The first to demonstrate that you opened up the man page to find the correct option. 
The second to demonstrate you running the correct command to display this information.

**Part two: 2 points**

Use a `man` option to search for (not in) the man page of a utility that could be used to create a new user.
Your screenshot should demonstrate the command used, and that you have successfully found a utility that could be used to create a new user.


You don’t have to run the command to create a new user, just find a command using the man utility.

**Part three: 1 point**

Make a new directory in your users home directory. The new directory should be **week-two**

Take a screenshot the demonstrates that you created a new directory in the correct location.

**Part Four: 2 points**

Use the man page for the `date` command to find out how to format output of the date command. 
You want to format the output so that `date` will display the hour (00..23) and minutes (00..59) or in the format “21:43”

hint there are two parts to this; one requires you to look in the SYNOPSIS section

Take at least two screenshots for this. 
One of a section you used to help in the man pages 
the other of the command you would use to get the desired results. 

**Part Five: 1 point**

Find the section in the man man page (the man page for man) that shows you how to open a man page from a specific section.

Take a screenshot that demonstrates this in the man page for man.

**Part Six: 2 points**

By default the command `man passwd` will open the first section entry.
Which command would you use to open the man page for passwd in section 5?

Take a screenshot of the command used

**Total: 10 points**
